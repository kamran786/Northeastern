FinalProject_BostonHealthCare:

--This system is designed to reduce the manual work at health care centers.

--Every sort of task is performed by this system, such as registering different types
of persons (i.e employees and patients), schedule, requesting tests, generating test
results and managing workspace of employees, etc. reducing much paper work
and burden of file storage.

--Also, the latest information is right available for the hospital employees wherever
they require. The system also facilitates the pharmacist to enquire about the drugs
and about the stock to be ordered and about the expiry date.

--This system revolves around Hospital, Pharmacy and Pathology.
